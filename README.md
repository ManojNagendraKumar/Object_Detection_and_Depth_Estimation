# Object_Detection_and_Depth_Estimation
Developed an object detection and distance estimation system using YOLO on KITTI dataset scenes. Evaluated performance with IoU, precision, and recall against ground truth. Estimated distances using intrinsic matrix calculations and validated results. Conducted error analysis to identify issues like occlusion and calibration errors for improvement.
